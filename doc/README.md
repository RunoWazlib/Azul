Title: Azul.

Description: This software is a digital re-creation of Azul by Michael Kiesling and attempts to reconcile the physical board game with the accessibility of the digital world. To achieve this goal the software utilizes Django, a high-level python web framework to develop the game. Python, particularly Django, is widely used in backend web-architecture. 

Planned Directions:
javascript frontend, python backend

Get Started:
Firstly, clone the repo and install pipenv, a python virtualenv management tool. Second, in the project directory, activate your virtual environment with `pipenv shell` then install dependencies with `pipenv install`. Third, generate an ".env" file in the project directory in accordance with the ".env.dist" example file.

To start the web application, activate the virtual environment as listed above and type `python manage.py runserver`. This will locally host the Django app, accessible by any web browser.
